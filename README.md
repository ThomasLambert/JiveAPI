Jive API


Is this repository you will find :
- a Jive API wrapper 
- a Jive analytics API wrapper
- a Bunchball API wrapper


     === Jive API ===

Basic Auth : all performed actions will be performed by authenticated user
You will have to fill in your password into wrapper.gs.
I've divided functions into places and users actions and you'll find them respectively into place.gs and users.gs as the names of the files suggest.

     === Jive Analytics API (Jive Data Export Service) ===
     
You will have to first configure you analytics. Please see with Jive or on Jive community.
Then you'll have a client ID and Client secret to fill in the file.

     === Bunchball API ===
     
You'll have to fill in the API key. 
The documentation is accessible by following this URL but you'll have to have a account (see with bunchball, they will give you the registration for free, in my understanding)
